Polynomial regression Using numpy's polyfit and matplotlib


## Regression Analysis
Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a **dependent** (target) and **independent variable (s)** (predictor). This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the [causal effect relationship](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/06/establish-causality-events/) between the variables.

### About

> In this project, a regression model is trained on randomnly created data using **numpy** and **matlplotlib** is used to show meaningful insights through plots. 
 
 #### Key terminologies:

 * random.seed() - will keep the random value constant whenever the value is recalled with putting random.seed() before using.
 
 * numpy.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size='any integer') - Draws random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution. 
 
 * loc - float or array_like of floats; Mean (“centre”) of the distribution.
 
 * scale - float or array_like of floats; Standard deviation (spread or “width”) of the distribution.
 
 * size : number of sample points.
